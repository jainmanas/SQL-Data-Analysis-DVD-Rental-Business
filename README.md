# SQL-Data-Analysis-DVD-Rental-Business
   
INTRODUCTION TO THE PROJECT:

THE SITUATION:

You and your Uncle Jimmy just purchased Maven Movies, a brick and mortar DVD Rental business. 
Uncle Jimmy put up the money, and you’re in charge of the day-to-day operations.

THE BRIEF: 

As a new owner, you’ll need to learn everything you can about your business: your product inventory,
your staff, your customer purchase behaviors, etc. You have access to the entire Maven Movies SQL database.

THE OBJECTIVE:

Use MySQL to:
• Access and explore the Maven Movies database
• Develop a firm grasp of the 16 database tables and how they relate to each other
• Analyze all aspects of the company’s data, including transactions, customers, staff, etc.
